### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Justin Penner, a multi-disciplinary designer currently working in Vancouver, Canada.

I design and develop fonts, but I also have a wide range of experience in identity design, printing, signage, and front-end web design. Most of my work is focused on typography and communication, and I always have a number of side projects ongoing.

### Letâ€™s work together!

Iâ€™m currently available to work with type foundries, design agencies, or any design-focused companies and organizations.

#### TYPE FOUNDRIES & TYPE DESIGNERS
- Font production and development work
- Collaborative work with type designers and foundries
- Custom Python tools for font development
- Variable font engineering

#### DESIGN AGENCIES

- Wordmark/logo design
- Custom typeface design
- Font development from existing drawings
- Font selection and research
